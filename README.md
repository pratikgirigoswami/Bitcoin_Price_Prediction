# Bitcoin Price Prediction

## Context

This project aims to predict Bitcoin's price based on its last prices and the result from the sentiment analysis of Tweets related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For that, were implemented an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network and applied different sentiment analysis algorithms.

Unfortunately, GitHub does not render the graphs from Plotly, used in the Bitcoin_Price_Predictor notebook. To visualize it adequately, please open it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OEfmmx4HKYJ4jbFQ-M5uHPcDqNW0b6kv?usp=sharing).
